        Agua Dulce is a small community located in the lower mountains of the
        southern coast of Oaxaca, Mexico. Its population, as of 2020, consisted
        of 94 total inhabitants--43 of which were children younger than 14 years
        of age. All the inhabitants of this community belong to the Zapotec
        indigenous group, and an overwhelming majority speak their local
        language and Spanish.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main economic activity sustaining most inhabitants is agriculture.
        The community collectively farms in an adjacent piece of land owned by
        one of the inhabitants of the town. Few of the community members have
        chosen to take jobs outside of the community, as the semi-urban
        localities are at least a 30-minute car ride down the montain. There is
        no public transportation going up to this locality.
      </p>

        The school consists of a single building where children of all ages have
        class one day per week, as teachers are not able to access this remote
        community on a daily basis. There have been no teachers since the
        emergency state declared through the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is
        unclear when classes will be reinstated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other public buildings consist of a local clinic and a chapel in the
        center of town.
