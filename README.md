# Huricane Agatha Damage Assessment Map
Ada Developers Academy C18 Capstone Project by Ihovanna Huezo.

This web app utilizes Google's Cloud Platform Services to feature a map crafted 
through Google Maps API.

This map reflects data gathered after Hurricane Agatha hit the southern coast of
Oaxaca, Mexico in May 30th, 2022. Hridaya Yoga's Community Development Department organized
a party to visit affected remote communities and perform appropriate damage assessments.
In the process, the department partnered up with the community of Agua Dulce to, 
instead of providing temporary monetary relief, utilize the funds gathered through
the United for Oaxaca Campaign for a long-term community development project instead.

The data contained in the map reflects demographic data about each husehold in the
community of Agua Dulce and the conditions each family was living in during the weeks
following the hurricane. 

This web app aims to be a tool that the Hridaya Yoga's Community Development Department
can use to more easily reference their initial data as the project progresses.
